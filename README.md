# JustPark Backend

This repository hosts the back-end services for a comprehensive Parking Management System designed to streamline the operations of parking lots. Developed using Node.js, Express, MySQL, TypeScript, and Prisma ORM, this system currently supports basic CRUD operations for managing parking data. This is the back-end counterpart for JustPark.

## üåü Features

- **Authentication System:** Secure user authentication with password encryption and JWT tokens.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Three roles - Owner, Warden, Customer.
  - **Owner:** Create and manage parking spots, assign wardens, and check occupancy.
  - **Warden:** Monitor cars in assigned parking spots.
  - **Customer:** Register cars and pay for parking (Payment feature not included in MVP).
- **Middleware:** Role and token validation.
- **Parking Types:** On-street, covered, guarded, electric car charging, subscription options.
- **Parking Management:** Manage wardens, set opening times, monitor earnings, and more.
